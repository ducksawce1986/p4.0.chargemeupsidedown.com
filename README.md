Project 4: Combining elements of PHP, frameworks, databases, and Javascript

This application is made up of two parts:

1. A main landing page with a built-in javascript-driven application  

Upon first visiting p4.0.chargemeupsidedown.com, one comes across a "Boston gig-earnings calculator" javascript application designed to assist users seeking to perform at live venues across the city of Boston. One first chooses the type of group they are performing in. Upon making a choice, the javascript app should narrow down the list of venue options displayed to the user below. The user then may choose from one or several venues along a series of displayed radio buttons. Finally, the user must indicate how many persons are in their group. During every step of the process, the user will view updated earnings in dollar amounts, in real-time near the bottom of the page.

2. A user-driven, database-backed community

From the main landing page of the website (where the javascript application is available for any and all visitors to the site), one has the option to sign up for an account on the site's user community. This commmunity has several features, including the ability to submit posts, follow/unfollow other users, read other users' posts, view their own posts, and delete their posts. All posts are time-stamped, and the user can view the time-stamped date of their site account initialization on their profile page. All data on the community portion of the site is backed by an SQL-driven database linking users to their posts, and users to other users. 

3. Aside from the aformentioned parts, the site was styled fairly simply without the use of external textures and gradients. Two photographs were used as stylistic portraits for the site, with one of them serving as an initial link from the user signup success page.

4. The website has been pre-stocked with users and comments from the earlier project. Users and posts were taken from the p2.chargemeupsidedown.com project. This was done by pointing p4.0.chargemeupsidedown.com towards the p2 database. For this reason, one may notice that many comments date from November 2013. This was done in order to populate the site visually with easy to understand reference points, particularly so that new users may have other users to follow and read from when they join the site. Additionally, this was useful in displaying several of the capabilities of the site, particularly the 'delete post' function on the user profile page, and the indirect results of the user 'follow' function which display other users' posts.
